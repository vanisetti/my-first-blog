		<div id="intro"> I wanted to create a website which allowed college students to share and donate used textbooks in order to help people save money and encourage people to continue their studies. In order to create the website, I learned how to create a blog using a tutorial from Django Girls. This tutorial taught me the basics of creating a completely functioning blog.

			  However, even after finshing this entire tutorial I have only obtained a functioning blog. I wanted to create a website so I have much farther to go. But with the help of the new concepts I have learned, I know how to achieve that goal of creating a website. And I hope that along the way I gain new skills and my knowledge grows.
