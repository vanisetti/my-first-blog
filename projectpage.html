		<div id="intro">Goal</div>
		I wanted to create a website which allowed college students to share and donate used textbooks in order to help people save money and encourage people to continue their studies. In order to create the website, I learned how to create a blog using a tutorial from Django Girls. This tutorial taught me the basics of creating a completely functioning blog.

        For my project, I didn't really rely much on data. I used the sqlite3 database for my project because it is the default Django database adapter. Django was the website which provided tutorials and I used the one catered to creating a blog. They also made me install Django which provided me with a framework to develop websites.

         I learned A LOT in this project. Ranging from simple things to more complex aspects that I personally struggled with.The tutorial helped immensely because I was able to break apart each concept and at every moment I knew what was happening with my code. I knew how everything was connected and how it affected each other.


         Here   are some things I didn't know (much)about before this project-



         Virtual Environment:
         It is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects. It enables multiple side-by-side installations of Python, one for each project. It doesnâ€™t actually install separate copies of Python, but it does provide a clever way to keep different project environments isolated.



         PythonAnywhere:
         Deploying a web app on PythonAnywhere involves pulling down your code from GitHub, and then configuring PythonAnywhere to recognise it and start serving it as a web application. There are manual ways of doing it, but PythonAnywhere provides a helper tool that will do it all for you



         Models:
         A model in Django is a special kind of object which is saved in the database. Models in the database is like a spreadsheet with columns (fields) and rows(data).



         Views:
         A view is a place where we put the "logic" of our application. It will request information from the model you created before and pass it to a template.



         QuerySets:
         A QuerySet is, in essence, a list of objects of a given Model. QuerySets allow you to read the data from the database, filter it and order it. QuerySets also allow you to order the list of objects. You can also combine QuerySets by chaining them together which is really powerful and lets you write quite complex queries.

        Now, looking at my blog, it is satisfying to see how it turned out but there were quite some troubles I faced along the way. Although I followed the tutorial there were times I came across errors which forced me to alter some of the instructions provided from the tutorial. This allowed me to see the blog as I wanted it to be seen but some of the other technicalities didn't work out so well. For example, towards the end of the tutorial I learned to link the different webpages. There was a button which allowed people to create a new post but after creating the post, one couldn't go back to the list of the already existing posts. After making some changes, I was able to switch back and forth between the webpages but I could edit the existing posts.

		In the beginning of the tutorial I also learned how to create an admin page. However, towards the end I wasn't able to use it in the blog website. 

        There were some other struggles I faced which can be easily avoided. When I was trying to download Django, I couldn't figure out where I was going wrong. I made sure I was typing in the right code and that I had the right version for python. However, turned out that thee version kept switching back to the older one and I had to make sure that it was using the latest version. I also had to make sure pip was upgraded because only then Django will be installed smoothly.

			However, even after finishing this entire tutorial I have only obtained a functioning blog. I wanted to create a website so I have much farther to go. But with the help of the new concepts I have learned, I know how to achieve that goal of creating a website. And I hope that along the way I gain new skills and my knowledge grows.
